 can t think of how i d be running afoul of the spam filters with this post so here s the second try kissinger s book _does america need a foreign policy _ provides a few handy abstractions the ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between values idealism and interests realism and occasionally between peace and justice also he views historical american approaches to foreign policy as a bundle of three fibers hamiltonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to preserve balances of power wilsonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to further democracy etc jacksonian we should never get involved in foreign adventures unless we re attacked then we go rambo he has tactfully left out the hard realists as for the rest i gather wilsonians play the idealists and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect and jacksonians act only when values and interests overlap kissinger himself seems to be a hamiltonian much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions maybe i ve been too affected by kant but i can t see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a bismarck runnning it how lopsided does the us look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics dave the road to empire leads to domestic decay because in time the claims of omnipotence erode domestic restraints no empire has avoided the road to caesarism unless like the british empire it devolved its power before this process could develop in long lasting empires every problem turns into a domestic issue which should be handled very differently from international ones because the outside world no longer provides a counterweight and as challenges grow more diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent a deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the values that made the united states great kings and tyrants generically have followed the same power politics garner popular support by keeping potential oligarchs down in other traditions a king is a legitimate tyrant and a tyrant an illegitimate king in the us i d hope that we like samuel wouldn t naturally make such fine distinctions ,0

 begin pgp signed message hash shaNUMBER thugs of south boston and the revenge of the bandit princess the geodesic economy robert a hettinga sunday august NUMBER NUMBER boston when you think about it one way the fbi winter hill vs patriarcha angiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs put crudely and at its most racist the fbi and the winter hill gang were the mostly irish thugs and patriarcha s family were of course the mostly italian thugs think scorsese s upcoming gangs of new york only with counter reformatory overtones hoover s south boston social club putsch starting in the mid NUMBER s was particularly audacious in hindsight the u s federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition era capture of the nation s rackets by the italians from the irish the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york but for south boston the most irish place in the us only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all the result as we all found out wasn t swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone hoover was posthumously swapping it for oxycontin or crystal methamphetamine or more properly pcp the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulger s crack cocaine era reign of boston s drug markets like the identical fbi sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also rans in cities across the us as a whole went up whole orders of magnitude not mere percentage points as stalin said once quantity has a quality all it s own and make no mistake j edgar hoover was directly responsible that quality of carnage nation wide so yes on paper at least it really was just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another and the result was on paper at least business as usual same stuff different century with apparently decent people like mr salvati URL accidently ground on the gears of justice like so much hamburger however to be much more macabre about it that hamburger was greasing if you will an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love a perfectly functioning market legislated out of existence on paper if nowhere else by government fiat and the back door but still elitist will to power of h l mencken s famous bluenoses and busybodies it all starts like all true evil does from the most innocent of beginnings what she couldn t do to alcohol teatotaling mrs grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller manageable demand the bloody result was like nine more heads of the hydra an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition in more markets and for more things as the NUMBERth century wore on every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive or harmful or physically distasteful or carcinogenic or now apparently fattening and then prohibited exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years a larger market than before the prohibition hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly legislated barriers to competition imposed on them by the state increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances and finally the ultimate in evil the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end increasingly coercive axe handle beatings by our own government of the sacred liberty of the average but now unavoidably law breaking citizenry as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago you don t need government if nobody s breaking the law in some twisted corollary to parkinson s law governments to survive need more people breaking more laws or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time and to bring us back to the point david friedman would probably echo here his father milton s famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market and never the consumer much less the economy as a whole even especially if those sellers are breaking the law as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us and there absent the apparent grace of mr hoover went mr salvati in fact hayek himself in the road to serfdom couldn t have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoover s blatant imposition for our own good of vietnam era statist power at the neighborhood level and furthermore stalin couldn t have had better useful idiots than hoover did and neither by an absolutely literal extension did whitey bulger after hoover useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle idiots who were eating out of hoover s power craven hand for the entire middle of the NUMBERth century and whitey bulger s hand whether they knew it or not until the end of the millennium a time you ll notice which saw the increasingly steady imposition of mob violence and market control from both state and illegal interests way beyond the imaginings of even the most power mad rum running stock kiting movie flopping bureau pumping nazi appeasing irish bostonian little caesar or as for that matter his safely trust funded and now strictly political descendents in terms of actual financial economics think of what happened to mr salvati and the others dead or alive as a transfer price in human lives of the inevitable consequence of macnamara style vietnam era keynesian social cost input output accounting at its most despicable and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover and his co religionists in state economic control in the name of what really was as you ll now agree just a race war between thugs up in boston this shouldn t be a surprise really all race wars are at least fought by thugs though they re usually conceived elsewhere and endorsed at the time by all the right people for all the right reasons as far as the fbi itself goes remember mancur olson s observation that a prince is just a stationary bandit though given his penchant for women s clothing for other men and what s actually obscene for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference i suppose we can call j edgar hoover a bandit princess instead bandit queen of course would be a grievous insult to queens and real

it was march NUMBER in the early days of j edgar hoover s war against the mafia f b i agents say congressional investigators eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of new england s organized crime boss raymond patriarca two gangsters joseph barboza and vincent flemmi wanted mr patriarca s permission to kill a small time hoodlum edward deegan as they were having a problem with him according to an f b i log of the conversation patriarca ultimately furnished this o k the f b i reported and three days later mr deegan turned up dead in an alley shot six times it was an extraordinary situation the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved but when indictments in the case were handed down in NUMBER the real killers who also happened to be informers for the f b i were left alone four other men were tried convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder though they had had nothing to do with it one joseph salvati who spent NUMBER years in prison filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the f b i for NUMBER million for false imprisonment his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the f b i the justice department and some f b i agents growing out of the tangled corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the f b i s boston office in its effort to bring down the mob the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light including documents detailing conversation in which mr patriarca approved the murder they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform which has pressured the department into turning over records about the f b i in boston the documents show that officials at f b i headquarters apparently including mr hoover knew as long ago as NUMBER that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution j edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself said vincent garo mr salvati s lawyer he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants mr barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr salvati and may have implicated him because mr salvati owed NUMBER to a loan shark who worked for mr barboza asked about the documents showing that mr hoover knew of mr salvati s innocence when he was put on trial gail marcinkiewicz a spokeswoman for the f b i in boston declined to comment citing the pending litigation a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office in one of the first results of the investigation one retired agent john j connolly is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were f b i informers james bulger and stephen flemmi vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers the government reform committee led by representative dan burton republican of indiana has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureau s knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr barboza were involved in killing mr deegan a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime including who fired the first shot then on june NUMBER NUMBER mr hoover s office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer in a reply five days later the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr patriarca potentially could be an excellent informant the agent also informed mr hoover that mr flemmi was known to have killed seven men and from all indications he is going to continue to commit murder nevertheless the agent said the informant s potential outweighs the risk involved a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmi s murders the director does not even respond the investigator said there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia which he had largely ignored in boston f b i agents recruited mr barboza and mr flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization the winter hill gang led by mr bulger both sides got what they wanted according to the investigations and the trial of mr connolly the f b i got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families which controlled organized crime in new england mr bulger s gang was able to take over the rackets in boston sell drugs and even commit murder while the f b i looked the other way one reason the f b i may not have used its information about mr patriarca s involvement in the deegan murder congressional investigators say is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence r i headquarters the f b i agent who transcribed the

 date sun NUMBER sep NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER from brent welch welch panasas com message id NUMBER baaNUMBER blackcomb panasas com i would encourage folks to play with those NUMBER lines of code in text_selection and report what works well for them we may come up with NUMBER lines that work for everyone or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models of course that s an admission of policy failure but i m willing to do that i actually think you re looking in the wrong place i at least have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted or selected that stuff for me if perhaps not users of some gnome variant which appraently has been fixed anyway all seems to work just fine the problem is that a button NUMBER click clears the selection primary where it shouldn t the previous selection should only be cleared when there s something else to replace it even if the highlighting of what is selected is removed try this in any other ramdom application from xterm to netscape and see how it works there normally is no mouse based way to actually clear the primary selection that is set it to be a null string then because of the if i get asked for the selection value i will find something behaviour if you click intending to set the insert point the way most other gui s operate and then paste because the primary is clear but exmh still owns the selection because nothing else has taken it it does and finds some other ramdom stuff from either the clipboard or cut buffer which tends to be something that was deleted back in the ancient past and pastes that that behaviour to me anyway is the real issue once that gets fixed we can switch back to operating the normal select stuff click at new insert point paste mode of operation that almost everyone expects to work whether the select stuff is somewhere in one of the exmh windows or elsewhere kre ps this message is from my experience as a exmh user only i ve never really understood enough about x and selections to go gazing at that part of the code and see how it all really operates _______________________________________________ exmh users mailing list exmh users URL URL ,0

 URL september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER a m the wages of september NUMBER there is no going back september NUMBER changed our world those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short term view and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets this is a colossal misjudgment the collapse of the towers the crashing into the pentagon and the murder of NUMBER NUMBER americans all seen live in real time by millions the world over tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds which if and when they heal will leave ugly scars for decades the killers dealt in icons the choice of NUMBER as the date of death targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and american military power and centering their destruction on the largest jewish city in the world yes they got their symbols in spades but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant but static morally repugnant and the worst plague upon the arab world since the crusades by lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after NUMBER NUMBER they prove only ghoulish not fearsome the more the world knows of al qaeda and bin laden the more it has found them both vile and yet banal and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for it is one thing to kill innocents quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused united states easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio dealing with grim american and british commandos who have come NUMBER NUMBER miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run and the ultimate consequence of the attacks of september NUMBER will not merely be the destruction of al qaeda but also the complete repudiation of the taliban the iranian mullocracy the plague of the pakistani madrassas and any other would be fundamentalist paradise on earth foreign relations will not be the same in our generation our coalition with europe we learn was not a partnership but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of euro american globetrotters a paper alliance without a mission nearly NUMBER years after the end of the cold war the truth is that europe out of noble purposes for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic eu a NUMBER NUMBER person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords this sad realization september NUMBER brutally exposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings indeed as the months progressed the problems inherent in the european way became all too apparent pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility and constant american ankle biting even as europe lives in a make believe shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september NUMBER america learned that moderate arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations after september NUMBER being a saudi egyptian or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan syrian or lebanese citizenship indeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism oil and arms purchases like nato belongs to a pre NUMBER NUMBER age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies now we learn that broadcasting state sponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles and as likely to come from friends as enemies worst case scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more long term hope than stable regimes like the saudis governments that hate us have populations that like us and vice versa the saudi royal family whom NUMBER NUMBER american troops protect and the mubarak autocracy which has snagged billions of american dollars are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists and with good reason islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed the post NUMBER NUMBER domestic calculus is just as confusing generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq chicken hawks and worse yet such traditional vietnam era invective i think rings hollow after september NUMBER and sounds more like mcclellan s shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of patton s audacity in charging after murderous nazis more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly NUMBER years ago indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank god there is no generation of americans in the present military other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf mogadishu and panama who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women children aged and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high rises politics have been turned upside down in the old days cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik in the age of russian expansionism they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians thus they were so often at loggerheads with na√Øve and idealist leftists no longer the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics loot their treasuries and keep out the russians instead even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists the latter if multiculturalists often believe that democracy is a value neutral western construct not necessarily a universal good if pacifists they claim nonintervention not justice as their first priority the right not the left now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation and idealism with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september NUMBER and the subsequent terrible year and yet it is likely that for good or evil we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead ,0

 the only circumstances in which a business will not be ready indeed eager to do an additional volume of business is if it is physically unable to do so because it lacks the necessary physical means of doing so or because the costs it incurs in doing so exceed the additional sales revenue it will receive that is a fully retarded view of economics and pretty much the same kind of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts there are a bazillion factors that affect game strategies which is what the state of california messed up and the energy producers exploited i m not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like the blackouts is to reregulate ultimately we have to blame the people who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and exploitation given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state of california sucked does there exist a set of rules that doesn t suck if there does exist a better set of rules then reregulation isn t necessarily the answer you can t blame businesses for being profit maximizers yes the people involved were heartless and corrupt but mainly they just did their jobs the guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote the rules or if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good rules pro deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway lucas ,0

 tim another area for potentially fruitful study it s clear that the highest value indicators usually appear early in msgs and for spam there s an actual reason for that advertising has to strive to get your attention early so for example if we only bothered to tokenize the first NUMBER of a msg would results get worse neil schemenauer spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning of the message in pratice that would probably work fine note that URL s current tokenizer only looks at decoded text mime sections or raw message text if no mime exists spammers could put megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn t even be looked at except that the email package has to parse non text parts well enough to skip over them and tokens for the most interesting parts of content type disposition transfer encoding decorations are generated for all mime sections schemes that remain ignorant of mime are vulnerable to spammers putting arbitrary amounts of nice text in the preamble area after the headers and before the first mime section which most mail readers don t display but which appear first in the file so are latched on to by graham s scoring scheme but i don t worry about clever spammers i ve seen no evidence that they exist NUMBER NUMBER wink even if they do the open source zoo is such that no particular scheme will gain dominance and there s no percentage for spammers in trying to fool just one scheme even if they did for the kind of scheme we re using here they can t know what nice text is not unless they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their messages to each different one at that point they d be doing targeted marketing and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously if you re out to make a quick buck you don t waste a second on hard targets ly y rs tim ,0

marshall islands in the north pacific however the marshall islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations comment just because the rmi government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of enenkio does that make it true why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized and documented time and again for fraud abuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government namely the dom and sister nation the kingdom of enenkio the marshallese name for wake island comment nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak for dom but as for the kingdom we don t even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign his majesty king remios the sovereign of enenkio and eneen kio atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore correction the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for dom claiming to represent the mid pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france presse comment the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio who are forced to live in exile from eneen kio atoll lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps NUMBER years furthermore an article in agence france presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government my preceding comments apply the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an investment scam we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio but also will positively impact people around the globe in fact we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation comment the kingdom of enenkio has made no fraudulent claims of which i am aware and in my post i am responsible for all published information i would personally caution any countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of nations companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect however my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source furthermore the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over NUMBER NUMBER of the land in the marshall islands including recent attempts to sequester him against his will we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism a honolulu based attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in the early NUMBERs comment mr moore is not an attorney though he was living in honolulu in the early NUMBERs correction the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the owner of eneen kio atoll a k a enen kio halcyon disclerta wake and NUMBER NUMBER other names iroijlaplap murjel hermios who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls he passed away in december NUMBER and was fully recognized by the rmi government he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in NUMBER whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen kio atoll ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel sic hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf correction the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made possible by murjel s appointment of mr robert moore the adopted brother of hermios alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen to the post of minister plenipotentiary the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios and the people s behalf the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed comment since when is a special power of attorney an agreement the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen kio atoll which lies over NUMBER miles north of lawful rmi boundaries the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen kio atoll because the atoll by any name you choose was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in NUMBER nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act law mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen kio and any statement to the contrary is false fraudulent and irresponsible finally i suggest you as a journalist or publisher do a little more research not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio but into the prehistoric history

further more melchizedek dom is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the NUMBERth day of september NUMBER but it did not convey a lease of land it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments however a prior agreement signed in may NUMBER which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio transferred mr robert moore s rights to develop taongi from mr moore to dom it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence this was made possible because mr moore is the alab one class of landowner of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll from the principal landowner iroijlaplap paramount chief murjel hermios who was aware of and supported the transaction consideration if any under the agreement was personally retained by mr moore who is also the adopted brother of hermios now please understand that while mr moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf and that of the future use and

sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many marshallese because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation these scars on marshallese society have not healed thus a current state of adversity exists following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island the government of enenkio on behalf of the marshallese king issued the state of war a declaration and broadcast it to the world the people were displaced from their native

the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief king murjel hermios in retrospect the declaration has had little visible effect while a state of adversity does exist the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations the kingdom of enenkio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the marshallese people while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the u s congress to obey its own laws to conform to the un charter conventions of the united nations relating to self determination preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses it believes accountability requires the u s to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity the refusal of the u s to meet its obligations even to the extent that a simple

western persons what of the native discoverers the crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by

reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships en route to the philippines on war missions and subsequent congressional action were the sole basis of the u s claim the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east such a station was never established at wake island it was destined to become a military installation however formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u s president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed but since the u s abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in the first world war the objections fell into oblivion it is understood from written accounts of oral marshallese

wake island the u s cannot produce a title the hermios ancestral lineage passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers who gave the atoll its marshallese name their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership upon the basis of events and actions by the united states the administration of the kingdom of enenkio by virtue of the declaration yields to the recognition that a state of war exists over the island nation this is not however to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender sovereignty and independence

NUMBER fully disclose to the people of the united states u s strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen kio atoll by king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions disregard for human rights protected under international law united nations charter and conventions and the u s compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century note u s apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island kaho olawe also of religious significance has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens parting shot what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general the u s federal government more precisely which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe but considering its present source it is downright alarming it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years letters reports forms published articles press releases legal notices documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u s federal government our not too distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of manifest destiny which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago if this current trend signifies a resurgence it can only be considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record of american attempts at fixing up the world the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen kio atoll pre dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor people have a right to know the media a responsibility to show them in conclusion i reiterate that our focus from my point of view is one not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u s political philosophy

 m mike masnick mike techdirt com writes m in which world are we talking about that may be true for the m first sale but once something is out in the world the m creator loses control if i buy a chair you built and then m decide to give it away to my neighbor by you re definition he m just stole from you i don t endorse the whole riaa thing but to be accurate you would have to duplicate the chair so that both you and your neighbour could continue to sit down and yes i suppose that would be more serious they can sit on your copy but if you start churning out exact dups of a name brand artifact people with law degrees start to smell money for example i could copy a gibson guitar exactly so long as a i don t put orville s name on the headstock and b i license the patented bracing methods if i instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar on ebay with gibson written in crayon on the headstock and then claim it is a true les paul limited edition i expect people would get upset m why is it that people don t understand that giving stuff away m is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses to play the devil s advocate here it s not about giving stuff away it is about granting endless and cascading duplication distribution rights even if _i_ only make the copy i give to you that doesn t stop you from making NUMBER copies to sell m access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff this is the difficult question how will they draw the distinction the other stuff is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff this is why ms is hunting people with illegal windows it s no harder to dup than a linux cd only what is there that actually prevents people from doing it personally i don t think the issue should have anything to do with sales or units the issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit should be able to own someone else s intellectual property sarah mclaughlin isn t suing you it s her label s legal dept because it s the label who stands to lose sarah s already fat beyond her wildest dreams so a few bucks here or there or even if the well dried up tomorrow it s not going to really traumatize her unless she s been blazingly stupid with her money but the label like disney and mickey they need the cash cow so they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers on in limos and coke if you thought only elvis or brian jones or dennis wilson had problems with beautiful people deadbeat leech friends draining their riches think again the problem is really very simple because it is semantic and until we make the semantic flip it s unsolvable but like trisecting an angle all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different way here s the revelation elvis never ever made a hit record elvis didn t make the hits his fans made the hits his fans did the work cleaning toilets manning the convenience stores driving milk trucks sitting at endless office desks they did the real labour that paid for every last one of elvis presley s pills all elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often and pen or collect the odd song that all those people liked and wanted as something of their own but it s not _elvis_ who made them universal statements it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into their own lives it was pull technology not push therefore the question becomes how many times must these fans pay before they own what they themselves have created they pay royalties for listening to the radio for blank tapes for concert tickets for a beer in a bar with a cover band they pay over and over and over again for the right to make some hack writer s song their favourite song that s where the whole system has been seriously warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your thinking that it is the elvis who makes the elvis it s not it s the people who make them the songs are already theirs gary lawrence murphy garym teledyn com teledynamics communications inc business advantage through community software URL computers are useless they can only give you answers pablo picasso ,0

 i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora your corpora are biased in this respect though newsgroups have a strong social taboo on posting html but in many people s personal inboxes it is quite abundant getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than i though my own saved mail doesn t reflect what i receive since i save and throw away selectively much more so than in the past multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink i ll bite sounds like a good idea to strip the html in this case i d like to see how this improves the f p rate on this corpus guido van rossum home page URL ,0

 jeremy hylton i think one step towards deployment is creating a re usable tokenizer for mail messages the current codebase doesn t expose an easy to use or easy to customize tokenizer tokenize couldn t be easier to use it takes a string argument and produces a stream of tokens whether via explicit list or generator or tuple or doesn t matter all the tokenize functions in URL and URL are freely interchangeable this way note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would do any good or if it would in which ways customization could be helpful that s a research issue on which no work has been done the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical knowledge about how to parse mail messages but the module wasn t designed for re use that s partly a failure of imagination wink splitting out all knowledge of tokenization is just a large block cut and paste there it s done change the from timtoken import tokenize at the top to use any other tokenizer now if you want to make it easier still feel free to check in something better i d like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one the msg and msgstream classes in URL are a start at that but it s hard to do anything truly useful here when people use all sorts of different physical representations for email msgs mboxes in various formats one file per folder one file per msg skip s gzipped gimmick if you re a python coder wink you should find it very easy to change the guts of msg and msgstream to handle your peculiar scheme defining interfaces for these guys should be done i d like to see the tokenize by customizable too tim had to exclude some headers from his test data because there were particular biases in the test data if other people have test data without those biases they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include them or exclude others this sounds like a bottomless pit to me and there s no easier way to customize than to edit the code as readme txt still says though massive refactoring would help hop to it ,0

 i wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time i actually lived on a couple different indian reservations growing up in the pacific northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakota sioux country as well and my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of indian reservations than i have my experience being a direct result of living with my parents i do get a lot of my information first hand or in some cases second hand from my father the income figures for the indians are somewhat misleading mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income while it is true that some indians live in genuine poverty it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe not something that was impressed upon them the primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals typically an indian corporation of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe in most tribes a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation usually to the tune of NUMBER NUMBERk per person depending on the tribe the dividend money comes from a number of places with the primary sources being the federal gov t and various businesses assets owned by the indian corporation you have to understand a couple things first a great many indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises everyone gets a check for their share no matter what one of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment often NUMBER NUMBER for tribal members who are more than happy take their dividend and not work the dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole income for government accounting purposes unfortunately to support this type of economics when no one works they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works one of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk not indians second even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually by benefits and perks we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary american receives from either their employer or the government it should be pointed out that while many of these indian corporations are ineptly run and mostly provide sinecures for other indians a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions an example of this is the haida corporation which while having less NUMBER NUMBER tribal shareholders has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the NUMBER NUMBER million range and growing yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled about NUMBERk in this particular case and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use they don t eat their seed corn and have actually managed to grow their stash in contrast a couple islands over there is another tribe of NUMBER NUMBER people that has a net loss of about NUMBER million annually iirc while being regularly endowed by the federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets this particular tribe has a modest income in theory but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and many borrow money against future income incidentally in this particular case the people that are working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets somewhat annoying the federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible typically selling the assets to american or foreign companies and the cycle continues so what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems in a nutshell a thoroughly pathological culture and society few women reach the age of NUMBER without getting pregnant incest rape and gross promiscuity is rampant inbreeding heavy drug abuse during pregnancy and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above on one reservation my parents lived the hiv infection rate was NUMBER many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious they do have their own judges courts police etc in short many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become the most pathological societies that i have ever seen anywhere because of their legal status there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior there are many things that i could tell you that i ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself there are always good people in these tribes but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times and this is a mobocracy typically btw if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs try living on one of these messed up indian reservations it will give you an interesting perspective on things there are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous indians the first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely the second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part even if they maintain their tribal identity in both of these cases the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above the indians are often quite wealthy technically and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita and the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole it is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income the poverty is social and cultural in nature not economic this was my original point on a tangent one thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism many indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution that they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything but what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run it is like a family corporation writ large it seems that in a future where familial ties will be increasingly voluntary the general concept may have some merit in general western society serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics but with an arbitrary set of self selecting individuals damn that was long and its late and it could have been a lot longer james rogers jamesr URL on NUMBER

no analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet but here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xaNUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xgNUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xaNUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xaNUMBER is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first NUMBER bytes of a packet while the xaNUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBERu high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xaNUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup

prepare briefings how possibly to explain that some of the documents including the report that the senior official handed me which was physically indistinguishable from a high school term paper represent the government version of playing carnegie hall after the fall of the berlin wall dick cheney then the secretary of defense set up a shop as they say to think about american foreign policy after the cold war at the grand strategic level the project whose existence was kept quiet included people who are now back in the game at a higher level among them paul wolfowitz the deputy secretary of defense lewis libby cheney s chief of staff and eric edelman a senior foreign policy adviser to cheney generally speaking a cohesive group of conservatives who regard themselves as bigger thinking tougher minded and intellectually bolder than most other people in washington donald rumsfeld the secretary of defense shares these characteristics and has been closely associated with cheney for more than thirty years colin powell then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mounted a competing and presumably more ideologically moderate effort to reimagine american foreign policy and defense a date was set may NUMBER NUMBER on which each team would brief cheney for an hour cheney would then brief president bush after which bush would make a foreign policy address unveiling the new grand strategy everybody worked for months on the five twenty one brief with a sense that the shape of the post cold war world was at stake when wolfowitz and powell arrived at cheney s office on may NUMBERst wolfowitz went first but his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour and cheney a hawk who perhaps liked what he was hearing did not call time on him powell didn t get to present his alternate version of the future of the united states in the world until a couple of weeks later cheney briefed president bush using material mostly from wolfowitz and bush prepared his major foreign policy address but he delivered it on august NUMBER NUMBER the day that iraq invaded kuwait so nobody noticed the team kept working in NUMBER the times got its hands on a version of the material and published a front page story saying that the pentagon envisioned a future in which the united states could and should prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power a few weeks of controversy ensued about the bush administration s hawks being unilateral controversy that cheney s people put an end to with denials and the counter leak of an edited softer version of the same material as it became apparent that bush was going to lose to clinton the cheney team s efforts took on the quality of a parting shot the report that the senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before clinton took office it is a somewhat bland opaque document a scrubbed meaning unclassified version of something more candid but it contained the essential ideas of shaping rather than reacting to the rest of the world and of preventing the rise of other superpowers its tone is one of skepticism about diplomatic partnerships a more forthright version of the same ideas can be found in a short book titled from containment to global leadership which zalmay khalilzad who joined cheney s team in NUMBER and is now special envoy to afghanistan published a couple of years into the clinton administration when he was out of government it recommends that the united states preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future khalilzad writes it is a vital u s interest to preclude such a development i e to be willing to use force if necessary for the purpose when george w bush was campaigning for president he and the people around him didn t seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift along the lines of the policy of containment of the soviet union s sphere of influence which the united states maintained during the cold war in his first major foreign policy speech delivered in november of NUMBER bush declared that a president must be a clear eyed realist a formulation that seems to connote an absence of world remaking ambition realism is exactly the foreign policy doctrine that cheney s pentagon team rejected partly because it posits the impossibility of any one country s ever dominating world affairs for any length of time one gets many reminders in washington these days of how much the terrorist attacks of september NUMBERth have changed official foreign policy thinking any chief executive of either party would probably have done what bush has done so far made war on the taliban and al qaeda and enhanced domestic security it is only now six months after the attacks that we are truly entering the realm of presidential choice and all indications are that bush is going to use september NUMBERth as the occasion to launch a new aggressive american foreign policy that would represent a broad change in direction rather than a specific war on terrorism all his rhetoric especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of congress since september NUMBERth and all the information about his state of mind which his aides have leaked indicate that he sees this as the nation s moment of destiny a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging because it enhances bush s stature and opens the way to more assertive policymaking inside government the reason september NUMBERth appears to have been a transformative moment as the senior official i had lunch with put it is not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the american public s usual resistance to american military involvement overseas at least for a while the clinton administration beginning with the black hawk down operation in mogadishu during its first year operated on the conviction that americans were highly averse to casualties the all bombing kosovo operation in clinton s next to last year was the ideal foreign military adventure now that the united states has been attacked the options are much broader the senior official approvingly mentioned a NUMBER study of casualty aversion by the triangle institute for security studies which argued that the mass public is much less casualty averse than the military or the civilian √©lite believes for example the study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to prevent iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction the american death total in the vietnam war was about fifty eight thousand september NUMBERth presumably reduced casualty aversion even further recently i went to the white house to interview condoleezza rice rice s foreign affairs article from NUMBER begins with this declaration the united states has found it exceedingly difficult to define its national interest in the absence of soviet power i asked her whether that is still the case i think the difficulty has passed in defining a role she said immediately i think september NUMBERth was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen events are in much sharper relief like bush she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of irresponsible states now define the national interest the latter goal by the way is new in bush s speech to congress on september NUMBERth america s sole grand purpose was ending terrorism we talked in her west wing office its tall windows face the part of the white house grounds where television reporters do their standups in her bearing rice seemed less crisply military than she does in public she looked a little tired but she was projecting a kind of missionary calm rather than belligerence in the foreign affairs article rice came across as a classic realist putting forth the notions of power politics great powers and power balances as the proper central concerns of the united states now she sounded as if she had moved closer to the one power idea that cheney s pentagon team proposed ten years ago or at least to the idea that the other great powers are now in harmony with the united states because of the terrorist attacks and can be induced to remain so theoretically the realists would predict that when you have a great power like the united states it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to challenge it or trying to balance against it rice said and i think what you re seeing is that there s at least a predilection this time to move to productive and co√∂perative relations with the united states rather than to try to balance the united states i actually think that statecraft matters in how it all comes out it s not all foreordained rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the national security council and asked them to think seriously about how do you capitalize on these opportunities to fundamentally change american doctrine and the shape of the world in the wake of september NUMBERth i really think this period is analogous to NUMBER to NUMBER she said that is the period when the containment doctrine took shape in that the events so clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat and that it s a big global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of as being in the coalition that has started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics and it s important to try to seize on that and position american interests and institutions and all of that before they harden again the national security council is legally required to produce an annual document called the national security strategy stating the over all goals of american policy another government report whose importance is great but not obvious the bush administration did not produce one last year as the clinton administration did not in its first year rice said that she is working on the report now there are two ways to handle this document she told me one is to do it in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out but it s our view that since this is going to be the first one for the bush administration it s important an awful lot has happened since we started this process prior to NUMBER NUMBER i can t give you a certain date when it s going to be out but i would think sometime this spring and it s important that it be a real statement of what the bush administration sees as the strategic direction that it s going it seems clear already that rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant american role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago some questions that don t appear to be settled yet but are obviously being asked are how much the united states is willing to operate alone in foreign affairs and how much change it is willing to try to engender inside other countries and to what end and with what means the leak a couple of weeks ago of a new american nuclear posture adding offensive capability against rogue states departed from decades of official adherence to a purely defensive position and was just one indication of the scope of the reconsideration that is going on is the united states now in a position to be redrawing regional maps especially in the middle east and replacing governments by force nobody thought that the bush administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms but plainly it is and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few months ago just before the NUMBER election a republican foreign policy figure suggested to me that a good indication of a bush administration s direction in foreign affairs would be who got a higher ranking job paul wolfowitz or richard haass haass is another veteran of the first bush administration and an intellectual like wolfowitz but much more moderate in NUMBER he published a book titled the reluctant sheriff in which he poked a little fun at wolfowitz s famous strategy briefing of the early nineties he called it the pentagon paper and disagreed with its idea that the united states should try to be the world s only great power over the long term for better or worse such a goal is beyond our reach haass wrote it simply is not doable elsewhere in the book he disagreed with another of the wolfowitz team s main ideas that of the united states expanding the democratic zone of peace primacy is not to be confused with hegemony the united states cannot compel others to become more democratic haass argued that the united states is becoming less dominant in the world not more and suggested a revival of what might be called traditional great power politics wolfowitz got a higher ranking job than haass he is deputy secretary of defense and haass is director of policy planning for the state department in effect colin powell s big think guy recently i went to see him in his office at the state department on the wall of his waiting room was an array of photographs of every past director of the policy planning staff beginning with george kennan the father of the containment doctrine and the first holder of the office that haass now occupies it s another indication of the way things are moving in washington that haass seems to have become more hawkish i mentioned the title of his book using the word reluctant was itself reflective of a period when foreign policy seemed secondary and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case to make he said it was written when bill clinton was saying it s the economy stupid not it s the world stupid two things are very different now one the president has a much easier time making the case that foreign policy matters second at the top of the national security charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism i asked haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as kennan s containment i think there is he said what you re seeing from this administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of ideas i m not sure it constitutes a doctrine about what you might call the limits of sovereignty sovereignty entails obligations one is not to massacre your own people another is not to support terrorism in any way if a government fails to meet these obligations then it forfeits some of the normal advantages of sovereignty including the right to be left alone inside your own territory other governments including the united states gain the right to intervene in the case of terrorism this can even lead to a right of preventive or peremptory self defense you essentially can act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it s a question of when and not if you re going to be attacked clearly haass was thinking of iraq i don t think the american public needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is saddam hussein he said also i d fully expect the president and his chief lieutenants to make the case public opinion can be changed we d be able to make the case that this isn t a discretionary action but one done in self defense on the larger issue of the american role in the world haass was still maintaining some distance from the hawks he had made a speech not long before called imperial america but he told me that there is a big difference between imperial and imperialist i just think that we have to be a little bit careful he said great as our advantages are there are still limits we have to have allies we can t impose our ideas on everyone we don t want to be fighting wars alone so we need others to join us american leadership yes but not american unilateralism it has to be multilateral we can t win the war against terror alone we can t send forces everywhere it really does have to be a collaborative endeavor he stopped for a moment is there a successor idea to containment i think there is he said it is the idea of integration the goal of u s foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to certain key ideas as to how the world should operate opposition to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction support for free trade democracy markets integration is about locking them into these policies and then building institutions that lock them in even more the first but by no means the last obvious manifestation of a new american foreign policy will be the effort to remove saddam hussein what the united states does in an iraq operation will very likely dwarf what s been done so far in afghanistan both in terms of the scale of the operation itself and in terms of its aftermath several weeks ago ahmad chalabi the head of the iraqi national congress the iraqi opposition party came through washington with an entourage of his aides chalabi went to the state department and the white house to ask evidently successfully for more american funding his main public event was a panel discussion at the american enterprise institute chalabi s leading supporter in town richard perle the prominent hawk and former defense department official acted as moderator smiling and supremely confident perle opened the discussion by saying evidence is mounting that the administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing with saddam hussein the war on terrorism he said will not be complete until saddam is successfully dealt with and that means replacing his regime that action will be taken i have no doubt chalabi who lives in london is a charming suave middle aged man with a twinkle in his eye he was dressed in a double breasted pin striped suit and a striped shirt with a white spread collar although he and his supporters argue that the iraqi national congress with sufficient american support can defeat saddam just as the northern alliance defeated the taliban in afghanistan this view hasn t won over most people in washington it isn t just that chalabi doesn t look the part of a rebel military leader he could fight you for the last petit four on the tray over tea at the savoy but that s about it one skeptical former pentagon official told me or that he isn t in iraq it s also that saddam s military is perhaps ten times the size that the taliban s was and has been quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade the united states left iraq in NUMBER believing that saddam might soon fall to an internal rebellion chalabi s supporters believe that saddam is much weaker now and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could finish him off but non true believers seem to be coming around to the idea that a military operation against saddam would mean the deployment of anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand american ground troops kenneth pollack a former c i a analyst who was the national security council s staff expert on iraq during the last years of the clinton administration recently caused a stir in the foreign policy world by publishing an article in foreign affairs calling for war against saddam this was noteworthy because three years ago pollack and two co authors published an article also in foreign affairs arguing that the iraqi national congress was incapable of defeating saddam pollack still doesn t think chalabi can do the job he believes that it would require a substantial american ground air and sea force closer in size to the one we used in kuwait in NUMBER NUMBER than to the one we are using now in afghanistan pollack who is trim quick and crisp is obviously a man who has given a briefing or two in his day when i went to see him at his office in washington with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and walked over to his office wall where three maps of the middle east were hanging the only way to do it is a full scale invasion he said using a pen as a pointer we re talking about two grand corps two to three hundred thousand people altogether the population is here in the tigris euphrates valley he pointed to the area between baghdad and basra ideally you d have the saudis on board he pointed to the prince sultan airbase near riyadh you could make kuwait the base but it s much easier in saudi you need to take western iraq and southern iraq pointing again because otherwise they ll fire scuds at israel and at the saudi oil fields you probably want to prevent iraq from blowing up its own oil fields so troops have to occupy them and you need troops to defend the kurds in northern iraq point point you go in as hard as you can as fast as you can he slapped his hand on the top of his desk you get the enemy to divide his forces by threatening him in two places at once his hand hit the desk again hard then you crush him smack that would be a reverberating blow the united states has already removed the government of one country afghanistan the new government is obviously shaky and american military operations there are not completed pakistan which before september NUMBERth clearly met the new test of national unacceptability it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass destruction will also require long term attention since the country is not wholly under the control of the government as the murder of daniel pearl demonstrated and even parts of the government like the intelligence service may not be entirely under the control of the president in iraq if america invades and brings down saddam a new government must be established an enormous long term task in a country where there is no obvious plausible new leader the prospective iraq operation has drawn strong objections from the neighboring nations one of which russia is a nuclear superpower an invasion would have a huge effect on the internal affairs of all the biggest middle eastern nations iran turkey saudi arabia and even egypt events have forced the administration to become directly involved in the israeli palestinian conflict as it hadn t wanted to do so it s really the entire region that is in play in much the way that europe was immediately after the second world war in september bush rejected paul wolfowitz s recommendation of immediate moves against iraq that the president seems to have changed his mind is an indication in part of the bureaucratic skill of the administration s conservatives these guys are relentless one former official who is close to the high command at the state department told me resistance is futile the conservatives other weapon besides relentlessness is intellectualism colin powell tends to think case by case and since september NUMBERth the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least the beginning of a coherent hawkish world view whose acceptance practically requires invading iraq if the united states applies the doctrines of cheney s old pentagon team shaping and expanding the zone of democracy the implications would extend far beyond that one operation the outside experts on the middle east who have the most credibility with the administration seem to be bernard lewis of princeton and fouad ajami of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies both of whom see the arab middle east as a region in need of radical remediation lewis was invited to the white house in december to brief the senior foreign policy staff one point he made is look in that part of the world nothing matters more than resolute will and force the senior official i had lunch with told me in other words the united states needn t proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the arab street as long as it is prepared to be strong the senior official also recommended as interesting thinkers on the middle east charles hill of yale who in a recent essay declared every regime of the arab islamic world has proved a failure and reuel marc gerecht of the american enterprise institute who published an article in the weekly standard about the need for a change of regime in iran and syria those goals gerecht told me when we spoke could be accomplished through pressure short of an invasion several people i spoke with predicted that most or even all of the nations that loudly oppose an invasion of iraq would privately cheer it on if they felt certain that this time the americans were really going to finish the job one purpose of vice president cheney s recent diplomatic tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter while gamely absorbing all the public criticism of an iraq operation in any event the administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of the world s approval when i spoke to condoleezza rice she said that the united states should assemble coalitions of the willing to support its actions rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure of international treaties and organizations an invasion of iraq would test that policy in more ways than one the administration would be betting that it can continue to eliminate al qaeda cells in countries that publicly opposed the iraq operation when the administration submitted its budget earlier this year it asked for a forty eight billion dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal NUMBER which begins in october NUMBER much of that sum would go to improve military pay and benefits but ten billion dollars of it is designated as an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on terrorism that s probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of iraq this spring the administration will be talking to other countries about the invasion trying to secure basing and overflight privileges while bush builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction a drama involving weapons inspections in iraq will play itself out over the spring and summer and will end with the united states declaring that the terms that saddam offers for the inspections involving delays and restrictions are unacceptable then probably in the late summer or early fall the enormous troop positioning which will take months will begin the administration obviously feels confident that the united states can effectively parry whatever aggressive actions saddam takes during the troop buildup and hopes that its moves will destabilize iraq enough to cause the republican guard the military key to the country to turn against saddam and topple him on its own but the chain of events leading inexorably to a full scale american invasion if it hasn t already begun evidently will begin soon lewis scooter libby who was the principal drafter of cheney s future of the world documents during the first bush administration now works in an office in the old executive office building overlooking the west wing where he has a second smaller office a packet of public relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of his NUMBER novel the apprentice quotes the times calling him dick cheney s dick cheney which seems like an apt description he appears absolutely sure of himself and whether by coincidence or as a result of the influence of his boss speaks in a tough confidential gravelly rumble like condoleezza rice and bush himself he gives the impression of having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction which the administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right the only truly prudent course when i went to see libby not long ago i asked him whether before september NUMBERth american policy toward terrorism should have been different he went to his desk and got out a large black loose leaf binder filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the middle east he looked through it for a long minute formulating his answer let us stack it up he said at last somalia NUMBER NUMBER the discovery of the al qaeda related plot in the philippines NUMBER the world trade center first bombing NUMBER the attempt to assassinate president bush former president bush and the lack of response to that the lack of a serious response to that NUMBER the riyadh bombing NUMBER the khobar bombing NUMBER the kenyan embassy bombing and the tanzanian embassy bombing NUMBER the plot to launch millennium attacks NUMBER the bombing of the cole throughout this period infractions on inspections by the iraqis and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime and the failure to respond significantly to iraqi incursions in the kurdish areas no one would say these challenges posed easy problems but if you take that long list and you ask did we respond in a way which discouraged people from supporting terrorist activities or activities clearly against our interests did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged further aggressions against u s interests many observers conclude no and ask whether it was then easier for someone like osama bin laden to rise up and say credibly the americans don t have the stomach to defend themselves they won t take casualties to defend their interests they are morally weak libby insisted that the american response to september NUMBERth has not been standard or foreordained look at what the president has done in afghanistan he said and look at his speech to the joint session of congress meaning the state of the union message in january he made it clear that it s an important area he made it clear that we believe in expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world he made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests and he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem and to begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is not a change of behavior on their part take the afghan case for example there are many other courses that the president could have taken he could have waited for juridical proof before we responded he could have engaged in long negotiations with the taliban he could have failed to seek a new relationship with pakistan based on its past nuclear tests or been so afraid of weakening pakistan that we didn t seek its help this list could go on to twice or three times the length i ve mentioned so far but instead the president saw an opportunity to refashion relations while standing up for our interests the problem is complex and we don t know yet how it will end but we have opened new prospects for relations not only with afghanistan as important as it was as a threat but with the states of central asia pakistan russia and as it may develop with the states of southwest asia more generally we moved on to iraq and the question of what makes saddam hussein unacceptable in the administration s eyes the issue is not inspections libby said the issue is the iraqis promise not to have weapons of mass destruction their promise to recognize the boundaries of kuwait their promise not to threaten other countries and other promises that they made in NUMBER and a number of u n resolutions including all the other problems i listed whether it was wise or not and that is the subject of debate iraq was given a second chance to abide by international norms it failed to take that chance then and annually for the next ten years what s your level of confidence i asked him that the current regime will in fact change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by he ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke slowly and deliberately there is no basis in iraq s past behavior to have confidence in good faith efforts on their part to change their behavior r a hettinga

i have some patches that seem to fix avoid this problem now it is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails long enough for ups s to run out and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply first i put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring so that if exmh is attempting for any reason to expand a sequence that isn t either a number or a range of numbers or a list of such things it will simply ignore the trash rather than giving a traceback this one solves the initial problem mh tcl was thu aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER mh tcl wed aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER set seq set rseq foreach range split string trim sequence if regexp NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER range just ignore anything bogus continue set parts split string trim range if llength parts NUMBER lappend seq parts that is amending proc mhseqexpand which is where the error was occurring before the code assumes that range is either nnn or nnn mmm so we should probably make sure that s true issue an error instead of just continue if you like but i don t think an error is needed but that just allowed me to create a similar problem in another place by typing nnn and rather than continue to fight fires like this i thought i should think more about brent s suggestion but rather than have the selection code actually validate the input which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid i decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input so i just stuck a catch around the msgshow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed this way any later expansion to what msgshow treats as legal maybe allowing a sequence name like prev or next or anything else can be handled just there without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it but while i was playing there i noticed something i never new before if you type NUMBER the NUMBER changes to NUMBER and so on for each that is typed i suspect that s perhaps an artifact of is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number so let it mean but now i found it i think its nice but if we can type NUMBER why not NUMBER as well that kind of limitation bugs me so i fixed it and then i wondered about folders with names containing the special use of as the toggle character means there s no way to type those from the keyboard so i fixed that as well this makes two different restrictions there s no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with but such a thing in mh would be a pain to use anyway so i doubt this will bother anyone and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current target folder name when the name being typed is empty i m less happy about that part but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder names with s in them to exist and be typed then since i was there anyway i decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me in normal keyboard mode s is the key used to show a message but if you ve just typed NUMBER and the ftoc is highlighting NUMBER as the current message and you want to now show that message you can t type s you have to type r instead so i fixed this one as well fixed here is in quotes as it assumes that the keybinding for msgshow is s if you change that to something else it will remain s in here i don t know enough tk tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here r continues to work of course and now i got started in fixing irritants in this code i also made it clear the status line if you abort message folder entry mode c or g previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings in any case what follows is the patch that does all of that i believe that if you apply this then the one above is probably not needed the catch around the msgshow will hide the problem i don t think we really need to fix brent s way of invoking it or include it anyway just for completeness i haven t run an exmh with the following patch but not the previous one so i don t know for sure that all will be ok then kre select tcl was thu aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER select tcl wed aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER

shaped car with wheels seated in this bowl the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs one in each hand billy s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary as he had been born without legs nature however had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and what was most important an unusually handsome face this was billy s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers by from their small change the cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century grangegorman and stoneybatter until a servant girl or an old lady would come along he would then put on is most attractive smile which together with his black curly hair never failed to halt the females the fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity billy in the bowl however wasn t satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices gambling and drinking as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk was falling the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street on dublin s north quays when billy heard the woman s footsteps he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane as his unsuspecting victim drew close the beggar moaned and shouted and cried out for help trembling with excitement the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes in a few minutes it was all over the woman lay in a dead faint and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his bowl his victirn s purse snug in his coat pocket an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition but failed to give a description of her assailant and as billy in the bowl had figured nobody would suspect a deformed beggar again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or stoneybatter on one occasion billy in the bowl tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her the incident became known as the NUMBER grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir hundred s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months billy in the bowl was forced to desert his usual haunts around this period dublin s first ever police force was been mobilised and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder months passed and billy in the bowl reverted once again to his old pasttime a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district but the beggar still rolled along in his bowl pitied and unsuspected then came the night that finished billy s career of crime two stoudy built female cooks trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help rushing over they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch billy thinking there was only one woman grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch she proved much too strong for him however and while resisting tore at his face with her sharp finger nails meanwhile her companion acted with speed and daring pulling out her large hatpin she made for the beggar and plunged the pin into his right eye the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy billy in the bowl was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl the grangegorman stoneybatter district became once again a quiet attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night daev _______________________________ rev dave daev walsh daev URL home URL weekly rant URL is it about a

 is the use of trusted hardware really worth it answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business model but in all probability no it isn t usually worth it so it comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker s job look at the dvds iirc css was cracked by reverse engineering a software player and one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that this make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards they have an internal procession unit around NUMBERmhz can we consider them as trusted hardware the ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of renting the system smart card do their own self encryption can they be used to decrypt data needed by the system the input of the system could me mangled and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service this sounds really feasible but i may be totaly wrong i may also be wrong about the safety of a smart card what do you think yannick gingras coder for obb oceangoing bared bonanza URL ,0

care jose sandoval author of mother aged NUMBER told reuters we still have time to repair the damage done to her that s my fundamental objective he added totally willing to help sandoval has raised medina s case with the office of first lady eliane karp and has asked the government to grant her a life pension something officials say is possible we re totally willing to help her said spokeswoman marta castaneda but suni ramos of the social action department of karp s office said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning such as kitchen and other household equipment it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed it is currently trying to contact medina and her family medina s husband raul jurado told reuters his wife remained skeptical she got no help in NUMBER that i know about he said she thinks governments never deliver maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true jurado said his wife whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists had turned down reuters request for an interview medical rarity no one has ever established who was the father of medina s child or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped one of nine children born to country folk in ticrapo an andean

her first period at NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER became pregnant aged NUMBER years and eight months and that when doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby they found she already had fully mature sexual organs her swelling stomach worried her parents they thought it was a tumor he said but shamans ruled out village superstitions including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town pisco there came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest he was later released for lack of evidence and doctors police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case sandoval who based his book on media and other published information and some interviews with relatives as medina herself declined to comment said news of the child mother to be drew instant offers of aid including one worth

family accepted in early june NUMBER was for the pair to travel to the united states for scientists to study the case the offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort but within days the state trumped all previous offers decreeing that medina and her baby were in moral danger and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them but sandoval said it abandoned the case after six months it did absolutely nothing for them happy ending though physically mature medina who sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms still behaved like a child preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby who was fed by a wet nurse medina stayed in hospital for NUMBER months finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a supreme court ruling allowing her to live with them again after taunting from schoolmates gerardo who was named after one of the doctors who attended medina and became their mentor discovered when he was NUMBER that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother he died in NUMBER from a disease that attacks the body s bone marrow but sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young medina married and in NUMBER had a second son NUMBER years after her first her second child now lives in mexico she appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject we just want to get on with our lives that s it said jurado adding he thought absolutely nothing of the fact his wife was the world s youngest mother he said the couple s main concern now if the government s offer of aid was genuine was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to medina and which the then government expropriated more than two decades ago that house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site he said its value was more or less NUMBER NUMBER and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own they live now in a modest house accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves paradise if the government really wants to help they should give us the value of our property he said as for sandoval he said he was optimistic that medina s story which he has studied since his student days would turn out well i believe there will be a happy ending he said as a result of the war corporations have now been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places

 i have translated the article in full see end of post i think that i ve done a far better job than the google translation at least it s readable now any corrections appreciated stuff in s is my and others additions to the debate my apologies if i ve paraphrased anybody incorrectly i will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed the article makes four main points NUMBER absence of critical clauses in this case the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn t specify under what country s law the gpl is governed NUMBER specification in english only that for the end user as opposed to businesses the gpl doesn t apply because it s not written in french NUMBER arbitary licence change the point here is that under french law the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily this is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long where to whom dates and times in the absence of such limitations the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim david neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all copyright holders that s not my understanding french law allows a gpl type licence _on condition_ that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear if they are not there is nothing to stop the original author taking back his work the lawyers see this correctly imho as a weakness in the gpl NUMBER hidden defects roughly this clause means that the author s is are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an it engineer so if linux blows up and data is lost then the authors are liable ciaran johnson says that m oft and others have similar clauses the point here is that they are _all_ invalid just that this one affects the gpl also niall o broinn makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a service leasing arrangement and that s why it doesn t come under this point i would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software sales even if no money changes hands as governed very much by consumer law in france anyway rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default see the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified under french law the fact that two ip lawyers in france think that the gpl is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract NUMBER roughly there may be other reasons under french law why the gpl may be invalid whole article freedom a is worth more than these imperfect licences specialised lawyers look at the gpl lawyer cyril rojinsky duly appointed to the court and the jurist vincent grynbaum both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the free licences and in particular the gpl they have published their study in the review proprietes intellectuelles intellectual property NUMBER and their conclusion is grim their approach is interesting the problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under french law for them the question is a moot point but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences and in particular the gpl the problem is not free programmes but rather the licence contracts of free programmes absence of critical clauses the authors tell us that first of all the reference to copyright is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the internet the idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another this is why under international contracts it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring french law american c the authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point qpl ibm public licence and the mozilla public licence specification in the english language next the authors remind us that at least in france no clause in a contract may be contrary to french law NUMBER however it turns out that a licence such as the gpl is contrary to french law in several respects firstly it is written in english and the fsf doesn t officially approve translations the toubon law obliges this sort of contract to be written in french including for businesses since the notion of user applies not only to consumers but also to businesses professionals c contacted by the editors of linuxfrench lawyer cyril rojinsky declared that as far as business is concerned the toubon law is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of european directives on the subject but whatever about that the problem is still valid for individuals and while waiting for it french law to change french companies have to deal with it since it is the law of the land a programme under the gpl can suddenly change licence another problem much more serious is that according to french law the author of a free programme can at any time invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence in effect the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act i e the licence and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees and also with respect to its location i e where such rights may be excersised and duration of any such grants NUMBER this is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licences briefly this means that in france or elsewhere if the author is french that which is under the gpl could revert to proprietary from one day to the next the problem of the guarantee hidden defects an other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee the gpl licences and others show that the software is delivered without guarantee you are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts and this is correct however whatever is written in a licence contract one cannot free oneself from the guarantee from hidden defects since it is imposed in the civil code this concept is poorly understood by the layman it protects the buyer whoever it may be individual or business since it specifies the civil code and not consumer protection law against hidden defects deliberate or made in good faith by the seller for example if one buys a pair of socks in a sale and the shop has a notice specifying that sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it several scenarios are possible you could have checked the socks before purchase the flaw is deemed obvious and you can sing for your money you couldn t check the socks they were packaged for example and in this case despite the notice neither refund nor exchange you may invoke hidden defect and have them changed or obtain a refund it s up to you personally i have already invoked in shops the hidden defect clause and it always worked well shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the civil code the concept of hidden defect is rather wide it is necessary that you hadn t the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then according to the civil code that you wouldn t have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect the third case which is much rarer is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect hidden but didn t inform you in this case not only does he have to reimburse the product but all expenses incurred by the sale metro tickets to go to the shop the fuse which blew when you plugged it in c this idea of hidden defect applies to all products including programmes this was made abundantly clear by the authorities and the courts surrounding yNUMBERk this is particularly inconvenient for free programmes since a site which offers a linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky if in the case of a free programme one could speak about a hidden defect since the source code was available he replied actually concerning the guarantee the question of obvious defect will arise this analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an it professional or not opensource has this advantage over the proprietary programme it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an it person but for distribution to the public at large the problem remains the same roughly speaking lawyer cyril rojinsky said it himself this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored during this interview we asked ourselves for example about the fragility of the gpl clause which forbids linking source code under the gpl with proprietary code in effect the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme if for that i need to link with a proprietary library communication protocol device driver i may consider as null and void this clause of the gpl the conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community freedom merits more than these shoddy licences which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort NUMBER une publication de l institut de recherche en propri√©t√© intellectuelle noNUMBER juillet NUMBER NUMBER une telle

instructions parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever NUMBER year old the e mail letter listed NUMBER addresses and contained instructions to send one NUMBER dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses

with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail

next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for URL time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at URL fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER
